# Two Sum

## Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

**Input:**
```text
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Output:**
```text
[0, 1]
```

**Explanation:**
```text
nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

---

## Approach

- Use two nested loops.
- Check every pair of elements.
- If the sum of two elements equals the target, return their indices.
